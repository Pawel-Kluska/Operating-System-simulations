Operating-Systems Simulations

1. Simulation 1 
First Come First Served
Shortest Job First
Round Robin

2. Simulation 2
First Come First Served
Shortest Seek Time First
SCAN
C-SCAN Implemented algorithms that support real-tinme requests:
EDF
FD-SCAN

3. Simulation 3
First In First Out
Optimal
Least Recently Used
Approximated LRU
Random

4. Simulation 4
Equal Algorithm
Proportional Algorithm
Page Fault Frequency
Working Set

5. Simulation 5
Algorithm in which the process firstly tries to be executed on other processors than the original processor and in the end gets executed on the original processor
Algorithm in which the process firstly tries to be executed on the original processor and later if needed searches for another processor
Improvement of algorithm 2. Processors that have a very small load try to take some processes from processors with a very high load
